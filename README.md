# etterna-graph
This is a Python program that visualizes various Etterna playing statistics. Written with PyQt5 and PyQtGraph.

## Usage
1. Download the code files ("Clone or download" button -> "Download ZIP") and extract
2. Install the latest version of Python 3 ([download](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/)) as well as Python libraries lxml and pyqtgraph.
3. Now execute the main.py file and the statistics _should_ pop up

Note: Currently the Replays load functionality is broken (not implemented yet). Therefore you'll need to hardcode your ReplaysV2 directory in the code (main.py) to see the manipulation chart (which depends on replay data).

# Screenshots
The screenshots are outdated at the moment. Current versions have different chart colors and a text box with top 5 most played charts and top 5 longest sessions.
