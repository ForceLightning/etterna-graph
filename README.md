# etterna-graph
This is a Python program that visualizes various Etterna playing statistics. Written with PyQt5 and PyQtGraph.

## Usage

You can click on the individual scatter points to see information about the corresponding score/session in the infobar at the bottom of the screen. The infobar is visible in the screenshots.

## Running from source

2. Install the latest version of Python 3 ([download](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/)) as well as Python libraries lxml, pyqtgraph and numba.
3. Now execute the main.py file and the statistics _should_ pop up
