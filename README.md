# etterna-graph
This is a Python program that visualizes various Etterna playing statistics. Written with PyQt5 and PyQtGraph.

## Usage
1. Download the code files ("Clone or download" button -> "Download ZIP") and extract
2. Install the latest version of Python 3 ([download](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/)) as well as Python libraries lxml and pyqtgraph.
3. Now execute the main.py file and the statistics _should_ pop up

**Important: currently some file paths are hard-coded for my system, for easier testing. That means this program _won't work_ on your system without modifications.** You can change the hardcoded file paths in main.py:38 to match your system or wait until I've though of a solution that enables fast testing _without_ hard-coded paths, if you want to test this program yourself.

# Screenshots
Those colors are ugly, I know. Those are completely arbitrary currently, because I haven't decided on a nice color palette yet.
